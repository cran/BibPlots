Description: Currently, the package provides several functions for plotting and analyzing bibliometric data (JIF, Journal Impact Factor, and paper percentile values), beamplots with citations and percentiles, and three plot functions to visualize the result of a reference publication year spectroscopy (RPYS) analysis performed in the free software 'CRExplorer' (see <http://crexplorer.net>). Further extension to more plot variants is planned.
